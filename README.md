# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This REPO contains a script to tidy up and clean the data made available
on an experiment to detect human activity using sensor readings from smartphones.
This is done by running the R script run_analysis.R.
The tidy data file is written to a data table file called tidydata.txt. For details see the CookBook.md document.

The REPO contains:


- run_analysis.R - An R script to produce the tidy data.

- tidydata.txt - The tidy data produced by the run_analysis.R. This can be read into R using the read.table command.

- CookBook.md - Detailed description of the run_analysis.R and
