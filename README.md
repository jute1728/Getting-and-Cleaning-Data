Getting and cleaning data course project - coursera

This REPO contains a script to tidyup a set of 
human activity recognition data that was made available to the 
general public. This is done by running the R script run_analysis.R.
The tidy data file is written to a data table file called tidydata.txt. For details see the CookBook.md document.

The files are:

- run_analysis.R - A script to produce the tidy data.

- CookBook.md - Detailed description of the run_analysis.R and 
an overview of the tidy data
